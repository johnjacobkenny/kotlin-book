# Kotlin Deep Dive

## Why

This book is meant to document my learning in Kotlin and is a way to give back to the developer community.

This will be a book that is developed in the open and anyone can join as contributors. I am happy to help guide any aspiring technical writers in their contributions :\)

It will be very raw initially, but as things pick up, we will refine it further.

### Inspiration

This book is inspired by Basarat's Typescript book..
