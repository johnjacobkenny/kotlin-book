# Kotlin Deep Dive

## Who am I?

Hey there everyone ðŸ‘‹, my name is Kenny.

I am a full stack developer with 5 years of experience primarily in web technologies \(Typescript, React, CSS3\). I am working at an e-mobility technology startup company in India where me and the team are focusing our efforts into building an electric motor bike.

I am currently learning and working in Android with Kotlin. I love to write and to help others too. 

## Why am I doing this?

This book is meant to document my learning in Kotlin and is a way to give back to the developer community.

This is developed in the open and anyone can join as contributors. I am happy to help guide any aspiring technical writers in their contributions :\)

It will be very raw initially, but as things pick up, we will refine it further. If you have some content that you wish to see in this book, go ahead and add it to the page called **Running log of concepts** under the corresponding heading of **COOKBOOK** or **FUNDAMENTALS** or **LIBRARIES.**

You can [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/johnjacobkenny) to see what I am upto, and send a DM if you'd like to talk about anything.

### Inspiration

This book is inspired by Basarat's Typescript book..
